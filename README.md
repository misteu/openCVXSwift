# openCVXSwift
small test project for openCV and Swift

There are two sliders to change the upper and lower threshold value for the canny function. Everytime you change the value, the output image gets updated. It is pretty laggy, maybe because of the image size.

Something like that right now:

# requirements

you need openCV (2.4) included in your project as a framework.

I used Cocoapods so you just have to run:
pod install

in your project directory.
